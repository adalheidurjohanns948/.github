# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋  

I’m a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. With years of hands-on experience, I’ve worked across various domains, from backend development to cloud infrastructure, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, Rust  
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, React, Node.js, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GitHub Actions  
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, IntelliJ, Jira, Slack  

## 🔭 Current Focus  
I’m currently diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and **distributed systems**, exploring how to build resilient and scalable applications using microservices architecture. I’m also contributing to open-source projects and experimenting with **AI/ML** integrations in backend systems.  

## 🌱 Learning Goals  
- **Rust** for systems programming  
- **GraphQL** for API design  
- **Serverless architectures** with AWS Lambda
